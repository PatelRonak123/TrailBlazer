1️⃣ Gesture-Controlled Snake Game Using OpenCV! 🐍🖐️
Excited to share my latest project—a hand gesture-controlled Snake Game! 🎮 Built using OpenCV, cvzone, and Python, this game lets you guide the snake using just your index finger.

🔹 Tech Stack: OpenCV | cvzone | Mediapipe | Python
🔹 Features:
✅ Real-time hand tracking 🎥

✅ Smooth and stable gesture control ✋

✅ Dynamic food spawning 🍩

✅ Game-over detection with collision handling

This was a great learning experience in Computer Vision & AI-based interaction.
